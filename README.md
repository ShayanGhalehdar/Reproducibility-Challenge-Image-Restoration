# Reproducibility-Challenge-Image-Restoration
This is a repository for YorkU EECS 6322: Neural Networks and Deep Learning Reproducibility Challenge. The target paper is Simple Baselines for Image Restoration from ECCV 2022.

With recent developments in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, image restoration has become a trending topic in the field. However, most of the proposed methods for image restoration tasks deploy complex architectures as their base models. The paper we selected proposes a simple yet computationally efficient baseline that outperforms several similar, more complex models. Additionally, it shows that common non-linear activation functions—such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Softmax—can be replaced by simple multiplication operations or even removed, introducing a Nonlinear Activation-Free Network (NAFNet). Following the original paper's methodology, we reproduced the models and trained them on two public datasets: GoPro (for image deblurring) and SIDD (for image denoising), achieving peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNR) of 30.83 dB and 39.32 dB, respectively.
